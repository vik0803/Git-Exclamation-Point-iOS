Git-Exclamation-Point-iOS
=========================

A Git on iOS project (using /libgit2/Objective-Git). iOS 7 only.

What's With the Name?
===================
The name comes from the fact that Github doesn't accept Special Characters in repository names. 
So I named it using explicit syntax instead.
